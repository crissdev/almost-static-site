# Almost Static Site

Almost Static Site is my boilerplate for creating quick and dirty (M)EAN sites that use static YAML/Markdown files instead of MongoDB as a database. Gulp build converts the YAML files into JSON that are served with Express for the web application. Foundation (SCSS version) is used as the UI framework.

## Main Ingredients

  * Node
  * Express
  * Gulp
  * Browserify
  * Angular
  * Foundation
  * SASS
  * YAML
  * Markdown w/ front matter YAML
  * LiveReload
